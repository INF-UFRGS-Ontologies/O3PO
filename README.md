# Offshore Petroleum Production Plant Ontology (O3PO)
The **Offshore Petroleum Production Plant Ontology (O3PO)** is a bilingual, BFO‑aligned domain ontology that formally represents knowledge about offshore oil and gas production systems.
It was introduced in the paper:

> **Santos, N. O., Rodrigues, F. H., Schmidt, D., Romeu, R. K., Nascimento, G., & Abel, M. (2024).**
> *O3PO: A domain ontology for offshore petroleum production plants.*
> **Expert Systems with Applications**, 238 (Part F), 122104.
> <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122104>

O3PO supports semantic data integration, interoperability, and reasoning over industrial asset information.
It provides a structured vocabulary for modeling production systems, equipment, processes, and information artifacts found in offshore petroleum facilities.

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the ontology can always be found at:

https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/ontologies/o3po.owl

### Previous versions

The source files for O3PO were previously mantained in the repository [BDI-UFRGS/O3POntology](https://github.com/BDI-UFRGS/O3POntology/). Current and future versions are *not* backward compatible with the former versions available in that repository, mainly due to updated IRIs and entity identifiers.

### Editors' version

Editors of this ontology should use the edit version, [src/ontology/o3po-edit.owl](src/ontology/o3po-edit.owl)
